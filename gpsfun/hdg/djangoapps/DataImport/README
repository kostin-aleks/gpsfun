django application for import data.

Currently imported data from csv files into models
(using model.objects.create(...) with selected csv and model field matching.

Currently realized: one csv can import only into one model.

Currently expected csv structure:

 field1 field2 field3...
 value1 value2 value3
 ... 
 

Date fields filled using dateutil parsing of csv values.


By default for import standart create method will be called:

    model.objects.create(field=matched_csv_field, ...)

To change behaviour just add special class method:

    @classmethod
    def _csvimport(cls, field1=matched_csv_field1...):
        ....

If _csvimport found in model then it will be used for import instead of
create.
